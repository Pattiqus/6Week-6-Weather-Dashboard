# Week-6-Weather-Dashboard
<h1>Traveler's Weather Dashboard!</h1>
<body>
This repository contains the source code for a Weather DashBoard which is dynamically enabled with Javascript while utilizing jQuery and the third party API, Open Weather Map.

The application works by first requesting the user to allow location data through the browser. 

If the user allows this, then weather information for the current location is displayed.
If the user does not allow then nothing is displayed.

The user can then replace the current location (or add a city if location was not opted for) by inputing a city name into the form and hitting the search button to submit.

This will then display the weather information for the current city which includes:

<ul>
    <li>Location</li>
    <li>Weather Icon</li>
    <li>Temperature (Â°C)</li>
    <li>Wind Speed</li>
    <li>Humidity</li>
    <li>UV Index</li>
</ul>

Information forcast for the next 5 days is also displayed.
