<h1>Work Day Scheduler!</h1>
<body>
This repository contains the source code for a Weather DashBoard which is dynamically enabled with Javascript while utilizing jQuery and the third party API, Open Weather Map.

The application works by first requesting the user to allow location data through the browser. This will then display the weather information for the current city which includes
    - Location
    - Temperature (C)
    - Wind Speed
    - Humidity
    UV Index

Using moment.js & Javascript the page dynamically changes the colours of the input rows based upon the time. This highlights past , current and future tasks witha  grey, red & green hue respectivally.
