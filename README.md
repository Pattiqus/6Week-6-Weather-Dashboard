<h1>Work Day Scheduler!</h1>
<body>
This repository contains the source code for a Weather DashBoard which is dynamically enabled with Javascript while utilizing jQuery and the third party API, Open Weather Map.

The application works by first requesting the user to allow location data through the browser. This will then display the weather information for the current city which includes
    - Location
    - Weather Icon
    - Temperature (C)
    - Wind Speed
    - Humidity
    - UV Index

Information forcast for the next 5 days is also displayed.

If the user does not allow then nothing is displayed.

The above data can also be obtained for any city by putting the city name and country code into the form and submitting.
